--  Rs -- a systematic Reed-Solomon ERASURE code over GF(2^8).
--
--  Purpose on a diode: protect a message that spans a small number of packets.
--  Split it into K data fragments, add M parity fragments, and send all K + M.
--  ANY K of the K + M that arrive reconstruct the message exactly -- this is
--  the MDS (maximum-distance-separable) property, and it comes for free from
--  the Cauchy generator matrix (Rs_Matrix), every square submatrix of which is
--  invertible.  There are no unlucky loss patterns: only the COUNT matters.
--
--  Why RS here rather than the LT fountain of gnat-lt-pro: at small K (a
--  handful of packets) RS is optimal -- exactly K survivors suffice -- whereas
--  the soliton distribution behaves poorly and wastes overhead.  LT wins only
--  at large K (bulk transfers).  This code owns the small-message regime.
--
--  The code is "systematic": data fragments are sent verbatim (slots 1 .. K),
--  parity follows (slots K+1 .. K+M).  So in the common no-loss case the
--  receiver does no arithmetic at all -- the data fragments ARE the message.

   --  The Cauchy matrix (Rs_Matrix) is the single source of truth for the code

   --  the SAME constants as K_Range / M_Range below -- no cross-unit "48 = 48"
   --  obligation to discharge.
