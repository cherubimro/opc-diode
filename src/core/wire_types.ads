--  Wire_Types -- the scalar types every on-the-wire byte agrees on.
--
--  One byte type (U8) is shared by the GF(2^8) algebra, the UADP parser, the
--  diode framing and the relay, so a datagram buffer can be viewed as field
--  elements or as protocol bytes with no conversion at the boundary.  All are
--  modular, so little-endian byte assembly (Part 6 5.2.2) never overflows and
--  carries no run-time check to fail.
