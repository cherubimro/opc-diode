--  Relay -- the proven core of the data-diode relay.
--
--  Sender side (Protect): take one OPC UA NetworkMessage, split it into K data
--  fragments, add M Reed-Solomon parity fragments, and frame all K+M as diode
--  packets.  Any K that arrive reconstruct the message.  A single-packet
--  message uses K=1, so M parity fragments are just robust copies -- repetition
--  falls out of the same code with no special case.
--
--  Receiver side (Collector + Offer): collect fragments per (stream, msg_seq),
--  erasure-decode once K have arrived, reassemble the NetworkMessage, and hand
--  it back exactly once.  A bounded dedup ring drops the late duplicate
--  fragments the redundancy inevitably produces, and drops a message already
--  delivered.  Fixed-capacity throughout -- no allocation, bounded memory.
--
--  What is NOT here: the UDP sockets and the scheduler that interleaves packets
--  in time.  Those are the trusted shell (src/, SPARK_Mode => Off).
